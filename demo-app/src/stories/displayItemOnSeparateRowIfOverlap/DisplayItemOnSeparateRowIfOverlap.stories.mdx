## Display item on separate rows if ovelap

If some items are overlapping, the gantt diagram doesn't display them overlapped. It puts them one beneath the other. 

This can be changed by setting the `displayItemOnSeparateRowIfOverlap` to `true`
or to a function that decides (given an item) whether it allows to be displayed on a new row in case of overlapping or it should be displayed on the first row no matter the overlapping with other segments.
